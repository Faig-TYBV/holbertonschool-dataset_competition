# Strategic Analysis of Azerbaijan's Transport Income (1995-2024)

### *From "Transit Nation" to "Global Logistics Hub"*

## 📌 Project Overview

This project provides a 30-year comprehensive analysis of Azerbaijan's freight transport revenue. By auditing open data from the **IDDA (Innovation and Digital Development Agency)**, we reveal how the nation successfully pivoted from a passive "Energy Transit" route to a high-yield "Aviation Logistics Hub."

## 🛠 Tools Used

* **Python** (Data Processing & Statistical Analysis)
* **Pandas** (Data Auditing & Time-Series Alignment)
* **Matplotlib / Seaborn** (Macro-Economic Visualization)

## 🔍 Data Quality Audit & Cleaning

Before analysis, a rigorous **Data Integrity Phase** was conducted to ensure a valid global comparison:

1. **Currency Standardization:** Converted historical figures from local currency (Manat) to **USD ($)** to normalize for inflation and devaluation events (e.g., 2015).
2. **Hierarchy Deduplication:** Corrected the double-counting of `Pipeline` sub-sectors (Oil + Gas) to ensure a mathematically accurate "True Total."
3. **Logic Verification:** Audited the "Total" column against the sum of individual sectors to identify reporting gaps.

## 💡 The "Aha!" Moments (Critical Insights)

### 1. The Strategic Pivot (2015-2024)

The data identifies **2015** as a historic pivot point. While the global economy faced challenges, Azerbaijan's **Air Transport Income** "decoupled" from traditional trends. This marks the successful implementation of the **National Logistics Roadmap**, prioritizing high-value aviation cargo over bulk transit.

### 2. Efficiency Audit: Growth vs. Development

A key question of this study was: *Is the sector generating real value, or just riding the wave of inflation?*

* **National GDP Growth (1995-2024):** ~31x
* **Transport Income Growth (1995-2024):** ~49x

**The Verdict:** Transport revenue grew **1.6x faster** than the national economy. This proves the sector is a "Wealth Creator" actively driving Azerbaijan's economic diversification.

### 3. The Aviation Takeover

* **Revenue Dominance:** Air transport moved from a minor niche to become the **dominant revenue driver**, claiming **41% of the total market** in 2024 (surpassing Pipelines at 33%).
* **Resilience:** During the 2020 global crisis, the Air sector proved to be Azerbaijan's most resilient economic bridge, maintaining revenue flow when land routes were restricted.

## 📊 Key Visualizations

* **The Growth Gap:** A dual-axis comparison showing the Income Index vs. the GDP Index.
* **The "Mountain of Income":** A stacked area chart visualizing the transition from Pipeline dominance to Aviation leadership.
* **Correlation Matrix:** A heatmap proving the strong statistical link (0.96) between transport revenue and national economic health.
